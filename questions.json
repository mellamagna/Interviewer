		"question": "What is Object Oriented Programming?",
		"checks": ["programming", "paradigm", "pattern", "object"],
		"answer": "OOP is a programming paradigm centered around the idea of 'objects' containing both data and code that interact with one another."

	{
		"id": 2,
		"question": "What is a class and what is an object?",
		"checks": ["blueprint", "instance", "outline", "class", "object"],
		"answer": "A class is the 'blueprint' of an object and outlines its structure. An object is an instance of said class."

	{
		"id": 3,
		"question": "What is inheritance?",
		"checks": ["inheritance","child","parent"],
		"answer": "Inheritance is the idea of a child class being based upon (or inheriting properties of) its parent object. Features common to all child classes are within the parent class."
	},
	{
		"id": 4,
		"question": "What is abstraction?",
		"checks": ["abstraction","data","hiding"],
		"answer": "Abstraction is a concept that involves 'data hiding' where only relevant code is displayed and is layered so that it is protected."
	},
	{
		"id": 5,
		"question": "What is polymorphism?",
		"checks": ["polymorphism","many","forms","types"],
		"answer": "Polymorphism is the idea that one object can take many forms, or that an interface can be provided to entities of many different types."

	{
		"id": 6,
		"question": "What is encapsulation?",
		"checks": ["encapsulation","data","group","surround"],
		"answer": "Encapsulation is a principle of OOP that involves 'data grouping', limiting the scope of functions and surrounding them within blocks of code."

		"id": 7,
		"question": "What are methods?",
		"checks": ["method","collection","group","task","call"],
		"answer": "A method is a collection of statements that perform a specific task and return a value to the caller. There are class methods and instance methods."

	{
		"id": 8,
		"question": "What is method overloading?",
		"checks": ["overload","same","name","different","parameter"],
		"answer": "Method overloading is when multiple methods are defined with the same name but different parameters (also known as compile-time or static polymorphism)."
	},
	{
		"id": 9,
		"question": "What is method overriding?",
		"checks": ["overrid","child","parent"],
		"answer": "Method overriding is when a child class redefines a method defined within its parent class (also known as run-time or dynamic polymorphism)."
